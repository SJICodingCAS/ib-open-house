Where Josephians got to play, interact and give of our time and energy to the children from these schools. Our Josephians spent time working on building a cement floor of the Bamboo School for future construction projects and learnt dances to teach and to dance along to with the Blue Sky Girls. We would also spend time interacting with the kids and Blue Sky girls across language barriers over meals and get to know them better, and for us to share experiences of our lives from vastly different backgrounds.The trip was a blend of meaningful contributions and enjoyable interactions, creating lasting memories for all involved. As well as taught the Josephians how to reach the last, the lost and the least.","The GEP trip to Sangkhla Buri made me reflect on the very simple joys in life, and how I have had been to busy in life to appreciate them. Seeing how joyful the children were in Sangkhla Buri despite living conditions made me reconsider how fortunate I am in Singapore. IB is definitely wearing me out but spending time with these children made me reflect on how fortunate I am to even take IB and have this experience overseas. I was blessed to be Trip-IC and to have been part of planning this trip for others to experience a fulfilling and fun trip and I do pray for the next batch of Y5s to experience a similar experience!",Thaddeus

Collaborating with the Frogsleap Foundation, our Josephians helped to install solar panels and lights in the houses of the Ma Da commune's Hamlet 5, bringing sustainable solar power to the residents. Our Josephians paid a visit to the Ba Hao Primary School where Josephians helped to paint vibrant illustrations on the facade of the school, adding a splash of colour to the school children's surroundings as well as hosting various activity booths in their classrooms, engaging the young students in enriching and entertaining games and activities. Additionallly, our Josephians explored Ho Chi Minh City where they paid visit to many iconic landmarks and learned more about their history. Through this experience, our Josephians had their world view expanded and deepened, while also doing good and impacting others for the better, making this an especially meaningful and memorable experience for them.","The trip to Ma Da was a very enriching, eye-opening experience. Going out to install solar panels and lights with the Frogsleap Foundation in Hamlet 5 allowed us to witness first hand the living conditions of the people there and empathise with them. While a simple lightbulb and fan may not mean much to us it makes a world of difference to the villagers. Seeing the owner of one of the houses we installed the solar panels in begin to cry when the lights turned on made me feel very fufilled that we were able to help them. The cultural night and school activities that were conducted were also very enjoyable, being able to learn more about Vietnamese culture and interact with the kids there and bring them joy. All in all, the trip was very fun and fufilling, a rather unforgettable experience. I hope that future batches of Y5s will be able to have an experience as wild and wonderful.",Sapiens

Josephians participated in two educational exchanges: one at Shishi High School, where Josephians attended lessons and night study with their Chinese peers, and another at a village school, where Josephians taught English to left-behind children from rural villages in China. These exchanges emphasised the value of recognising similarities and differences between schools in Singapore and China while reaching out to the last, the lost, and the least . The trip included visits to local historical and cultural sites including Kuanzhai Xiangzi (Wide and Narrow Alley) and Dujiangyan Panda Valley. Through these experiences, Josephians deepened their cultural awareness and developed as reflective individuals committed to serving others, growing as community builders and embodying the spirit of becoming men and women for others.","This trip to Chengdu was truly an enriching experience. Attending a school day at Shishi High School, I was impressed by my Chinese counterparts' dedication and vigour in their academics. Visiting the village school deeply moved me as I witnessed the left-behind children's passion for learning despite their hardships, deepening my gratitude for my own opportunities. Exploring Chengdu's cultural landmarks and watching the Sichuan opera broadened my appreciation for the city's rich heritage. I truly cherish the friendships and memories made during this trip. I hope the future Year 5s will enjoy equally meaningful and rewarding experiences on their trips!",Tricia

Working alongside local communities, the group contributed to the construction of Earth homes using only mud and water, promoting sustainable living practices that aligned with Chiang Mai's eco-conscious values. Besides their service work, Josephians gained valuable insights into wildlife conservation during a visit to the Elephant Sanctuary, where they learned about the efforts to protect these majestic creatures and their natural environments. The trip also included a visit to the majestic Wat Phra That Doi Suthep temple, offering a deeper understanding of Thailand's religious practices. Exploring the natural beauty of Chiang Mai, the group trekked to the breathtaking Bua Tong Waterfall, where they connected with nature when they scaled its unique, sticky limestone rocks. Kratong making, cooking and enjoying local dances are some experiences among others that delved into local cultural practices that allowed students to feel the authentic local experience. Throughout the journey, Josephians not only learned about diverse cultures but simultaneously formed strong bonds with one another, growing closer by the shared experiences and the joy of meaningful connections. This GEP trip definitely fostered a greater sense of global awareness and personal growth, empowering them to become men and women for others.","Going into this GEP trip to Chiang Mai, I expected to simply have fun with my friends, but what I ended up gaining was so much more. Living in an Earth home alongside the local community was an experience that grounded me and deepened my connection with Mother Nature. It showed me the beauty of sustainable living practices, which opened my eyes to how we can live more harmoniously with the environment. What struck me most, however, was how the local community taught me to truly value the little things in life, things I once took for granted. I now find myself feeling grateful for even the smallest comforts, and I don't overlook the simple joys in my daily life anymore. The trip was not simply about building homes and learning about conservation, but about gaining a sense of perspective and humility. I know this priceless trip will stay with me for years to come and I genuinely hope future Josephians will have a similar journey that will shape their perspectives in the same meaningful way.",Cristy
"Siem Reap, Cambodia",../assets/images/gep/siemreap/siemreap-1.jpg,../assets/images/gep/siemreap/siemreap-2.jpg,../assets/images/gep/siemreap/siemreap-3.jpg,../assets/images/gep/siemreap/siemreap-4.jpg,../assets/images/gep/siemreap/siemreap-5.jpg,../assets/images/gep/siemreap/siemreap-6.jpg,"The GEP trip to Siem Reap, Cambodia provided a rich platform for Josephians to explore Cambodian culture, heritage and history, whilst engaging them in activities to benefit the community. Josephians stayed in the heart of the Phum Bos village, truly immersing themselves in Cambodian culture, including captivating traditional Cambodian dances and a Sports Day alongside village children, forming new friendships and great memories along the way. Alongside World Volunteers, Josephians assisted in the building of an Eco-Bungalow - to help promote sustainable tourism in the community - by helping to mix, shape and lay mud-bricks. Josephians also explored Siem Reap, with visits to the APOPO humanitarian centre, giving them insights into the war-torn history of Siem Reap, and visits to Angkor Wat and the Phare Circus, deepening their connection with Cambodian culture and heritage. Overall, the trip not only helped Josephians to recognize their privileges, but also showed them how they can give back through service, as men and women for others.","The trip to Siem Reap was truly transformative. I had a great time with many of the activities, like making mud-bricks and playing volleyball with all the local kids, but what stood out the most for me was getting the opportunity to experience rural life, which really made me appreciate all the luxuries I've been afforded living in Singapore. Before I came on the trip, many people were hyping up Angkor Wat, and it truly was a sight to behold, but personally, I found the Phare Circus, with crazy acrobatics and loud rock music, to be the most exciting part of exploring Siem Reap. The trip also allowed me to get much closer with my friends, and it's something I know we'll always remember and cherish. I'm incredibly thankful for this experience and I'd really recommend the trip for any Y5s and I know they'll have a great time like we did!",Abhi Parekhji

Josephians had the chance to visit the Vietnam National Fine Art Museum, the Ho Chi Minh Museum, and Hoa Lo Prison. From the museum exhibits, Josephians could appreciate the different art styles of the Vietnamese artists, influenced by events like the Vietnam War, and more about Uncle Ho's life and status as a national hero. Our Josephians also paid a visit to the Blue Dragon Children's Foundation, where they learned about the challenges faced by street children in Vietnam. The trip also included a 500-step climb up Hang Mua Mountain, and a hike in Cuc Phuong National Park, building resilience in the Josephians. They also had the opportunity to visit several animal conservation centres, where they learned how these centres are trying to rescue and rehabilitate Vietnam's endangered animals. Our Josephians also visited several night markets in Hanoi, allowing them to fully immerse in Vietnamese life. They forged strong bonds with each other during this trip, while learning more about the world outside of Singapore, gaining global perspectives, and developing international mindedness.","This GEP to Hanoi was really eye-opening for me, as it allowed me to learn more about Vietnam. When we visited the Blue Dragon Foundation, I learned how fortunate I actually am and that there are so many people in need around the world that I did not know of. I enjoyed the homestay experience too, as I had the opportunity to watch traditional dances and live with a Vietnamese family. Originally, as I stepped on the plane to Hanoi, I was excited for this trip as I thought it would simply be a fun trip with my friends, without much consideration. However, as I left Hanoi, I realised how meaningful this trip had been, from the hike, to spending time at the night market, to the animal endangered center, I think all of these were really interesting and beneficial to me, allowing me to step out of my comfort zone many times.",Gwen

At IPEKA BSD Christian School, Josephians attended lessons and interacted with local students, forming friendships and gaining insights into their educational environment. This exchange deepened cultural understanding and broadened perspectives. Immersive experiences such as a Wayang puppet show and an Angklung performance showcased Indonesia's rich artistic heritage. These performances offered a firsthand appreciation of traditional storytelling and music, emphasizing the importance of preserving cultural legacies. The trip also encouraged Josephians to reflect on the similarities and differences between cultures, fostering empathy and respect for diversity. Beyond cultural discovery, the programme instilled values of global-mindedness and mutual understanding, shaping participants into men and women for others. This enriching experience emphasized the power of connection and the significance of cultural appreciation in today's interconnected world.","My GEP trip to Jakarta was an incredibly enlightening and memorable trip. We were able to obtain a rare glimpse into the rich cultural and socioeconomic diversity of Jakarta through a variety of museums, schools and landmarks. This provided us with rare insights into the lives of people from different backgrounds and the problems they face from air pollution to traffic congestion. This gave me a new appreciation for my privileged life in Singapore. The trip also facilitated a growth in my cultural understanding of Indonesian traditions as we were able to see wayang kulit (shadow puppeting) performed by a master as well as a mesmerising Ankhlung performance in Bandung. This was a truly unforgettable trip that I hope the future y5s can continue to experience.",Triston

Josephians were able to have opportunities to teach and play with the children there, as well as help paint the walls of the school. This not only broke up the monotony of school life for the Cambodian children, but also allowed the Josephians to get closer and bond with their students. The Josephians learnt to appreciate the simplicity of the Cambodian lifestyle and understand the privilege that they were given back in Singapore. The service aspect of this trip taught us the true values of Faith, Service, and Community. Firstly, the Josephians had faith in each other, and also in the Cambodian students, forging strong bonds and even stronger memories. The GEP trip also gave the Josephians a chance to experience the unique culture and history of Cambodia. From museum tours that showcased the horrors of the Khmer Rouge, to performances that underscored the uniqueness of Cambodian arts and music, Josephians learnt appreciate the cultures of other countries. Secondly, the Josephians provided service to the poor and less-fortunate, using the privilege given to them to aid and assist in the lives of the Cambodian students. Lastly, the value and importance of community was exemplified when the Josephians, teachers, brothers, sisters, and Cambodian students came together to interact as one large Lasallian community that transcended the borders of countries and languages. It was an eye-opening, heartwarming, and touching experience that taught everyone what it means to be a Josephian, and a man for others.","During the GEP trip to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, I was particularly touched by the selflessness of the students of La Salle Pouthum School. Since the school provides free education and meals for hundreds of children from rural villages, I initially assumed our group would have much to offer to them by engaging them in educational activities and games. Most of the children are impoverished ' yet, they have so much love to give. On the very first morning of our visit, I, and many others, were already swarmed by a flock of children, each of my limbs embraced by a tiny pair of hands. The sheer intensity of their fervent affection was certainly formidable but incredibly heartwarming. For the entirety of our four days at the school, the children showered us endlessly with love and warmth and even offered us parting gifts of stickers and small toys out of their own pockets. I cannot begin to describe the unimaginable extent of the love of these children, who gave me so much more than I gave to them. As I recall the tearful goodbyes of the children and my friends alike, I am assured that we will hold these precious memories close to our hearts in the years ahead.",Lucas Teo
