As such, SJIU occasionally goes out as a CAS to have fun together while simultaneously bonding with one another in order to form stronger bonds as well as to understand each other better. Dinners after training and sometimes outings to the beach all play a part in getting us to become closer to one another so as to build a stronger team. 

In late May this year, the year 5 frisbee girls were given the opportunity to take part in the Inter-JC competition for frisbee, alongside their teammates from year 6. Despite this being the first competition that the year 5s could compete in, they demonstrated astounding collaboration and determination — cheering each other on from the sidelines, refilling each other’s bottles and giving constructive feedback to one another in between points. Despite losing the competition, the team managed to clinch the Spirit Award, awarded to team for their sportsmanship on the field. The competition was an essential milestone for the team’s journey, not only in terms of strengthening their skills, but also in fortifying their relationships with one another.","Tuesdays and Thursdays, 3-5pm"
