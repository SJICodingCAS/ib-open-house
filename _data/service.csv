3,C3 ACE Programme for Youths ,../assets/images/CAS/S/c3-ace.jpeg,"ACE is a CAS dedicated to service at its core. Our partnering organisation, C3, works with students to create and host events that bless the lives of the less-privileged. C3 ACE’s beneficiaries include children, the youth and the elderly, allowing students to step out of their comfort zone into these people’s lives and blessing them through volunteering work. Here are some service opportunities our members have participated in.

<br><br>First, the volunteers and the children visited the ArtScience Museum, followed by a stroll through Marina Bay Sands and a McDonald's lunch. As the children come from low-income backgrounds, their limited outing opportunities made this day special for them. Witnessing their interaction with art through technology was very heartening. This experience underscores the potential for volunteers to connect with the broader community, making a positive impact through shared moments of delight.

<br><br>Part of the dumpling festival celebrations, our team created a video documenting the history of the dumpling festival for the elderly, followed by a short quiz to engage them. Subsequently, we hosted an origami arts and craft mini-competition with prizes going to the best ones. We finished off the event with a groovy busking session where the elderly danced along energetically to the tunes. At the end of the event, we gave all the elderly zong-zi, sticky rice dumplings for them to enjoy.

<br><br>As part of the Youth TAT project, we bonded with youths ranging from 14 to 17 years old, keeping them company through mobile games. The eye-opening experience exposed us to youths from various backgrounds. With new friendships forged with these youths, this project gave us a sense of fulfilment.",Ad-Hoc
