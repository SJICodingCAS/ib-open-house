        <h1>Joint Admission Exercise (JAE)</h1>
        <h2>Admission by GCE O ‘Level’ Result</h2>
        <p>
            Admission into the SJI IBDP is primarily via the JAE which is conducted by the Ministry of Education (MOE). 
            It is based on the student’s GCE O ‘Level’ L1R5 Aggregate Score. In accordance with the guidelines provided by MOE, 
            SJI's Secondary 4 OP students will not receive bonus points for being an affiliated School. Bonus points for CCA and 
            Higher Mother Tongue are applicable for admission. <br><br>

            Parents and students can take references to SJI’s past year cut-off school in the table below:
