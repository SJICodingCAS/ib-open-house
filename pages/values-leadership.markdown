# Josephians and IB Learners

## IB Learner Profile

The International Baccalaureate (IB) Learner Profile encompasses ten key attributes that guide students' personal and academic development. These attributes include inquirers, knowledgeable, thinkers, communicators, principled, open-minded, caring, risk-takers, balanced, and reflective. Students are encouraged to be curious, open to diverse perspectives, ethical, empathetic, and willing to take on new challenges. The IB Learner Profile aims to foster well-rounded individuals who possess integrity, critical thinking skills, and a commitment to making a positive impact on the world. This framework serves as the foundation for IB educational programs, nurturing students who are academically competent, socially responsible, and equipped to contribute positively to society and the global community.

## Josephian Formation Journey

The Josephian Formation Journey serves as a framework for guiding students on their path to becoming Josephians, drawing inspiration from the MOE Character and Citizenship Education curriculum. This journey comprises three main themes: Identity, Choices, and Relationship. The Identity component focuses on self-awareness, self-management, and discovering aspirations. Choices lessons emphasize responsibility, moral values, and reflective decision-making, nurturing students to become principled individuals driven by faith and passion. The Relationship aspect fosters social awareness, civic consciousness, and effective relationship management, transforming students into people-centered individuals and community-builders, acknowledging that they do not exist in isolation but as integral parts of a broader community.

# Student Leadership

The focus of leadership development in SJI is centred on the Lasallian values of Faith, Service and Community.

We recognize that every student has the potential to lead. The school provides a wide range of opportunities for our students to exercise leadership.

In SJI, to LEAD means to SERVE. Student leaders are developed to know how to share their vision, enable their team members, be responsive to changes, be value-centred and always be encouraging to those whom they lead and work with.

Our students are provided with training during the different academic years to enable them to be effective in their leadership role.

Every student is expected to be an agent for the transmission of the Lasallian values of Faith, Service and Community to his/her fellow Josephians. They are encouraged to serve and lead others to add value to our school community, society, their friends and families and ourselves. They take a holistic approach to work, promote a sense of community and share responsibility in decision-making.
