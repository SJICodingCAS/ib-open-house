# Join Us on Our Field Trips!
Join our Josephians vicariously on our various field trips to different countries in 2023!

## Binh Phuoc, Viet Nam
The Global Education Programme trip to Binh Phuoc, Vietnam, offered Josephians the opportunity to explore a new culture and engage in meaningful service activities. Collaborating with the Frogsleap Foundation, Josephians installed solar panels in the Minh Tam commune, addressing the community's electricity challenges in a self-sustaining manner. This initiative provided opportunities for cultural exchange and a deeper understanding of local struggles. In addition, donations of English books and stationery were made to Minh Tam Secondary School, supporting the students’ education. <br><br>

This GEP facilitated cultural immersion through interactions with Vietnamese students from the local community and the Frogsleap Foundation, breaking down cultural barriers. Josephians also explored Ho Chi Minh City, experiencing the contrast between urban and rural Vietnam. Visits to iconic landmarks deepened their connection with history, culture, and architecture. Beyond tangible outcomes, the GEP trip fostered personal and collective growth, cultivating a sense of global-mindedness in Josephians as they grow to become men and women for others.

        "This GEP to Binh Phouc was an eye-opening experience for me. Partnering with Frogsleap Foundation to install solar panels and lights in the homes of the less privileged made us empathise with them and understand their living conditions. This opportunity helped us understand the resilience of the Vietnamese citizens in carrying out everyday activities even if they lack basic necessities that we have difficulties living without. This trip also allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of Vietnamese culture such as their dance, music and even their traditional sewing techniques. This experience was definitely one that we will never forget! I am so grateful to have been part of this wonderful GEP and am looking forward to the new batches of Y5s having similarly great experiences in the years to come."

## Ha Noi, Viet Nam
During this Vietnam GEP trip, we explored the mountainous town of Sapa and Vietnam's capital, Hanoi. The first leg of the trip took place in Sapa, where we engaged in fruitful service learning activities at a local school, interacted with locals while hiking, and slept in a traditional homestay in the mountains. This rural experience taught many of us to never take our circumstances for granted and the importance of humility. The next leg of the trip in Hanoi took on a more reserved stance, exposing us to the cultural aspects of Vietnam. We visited Hoa Lo prison, several Pagodas in the city, and Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum. During this educational tour, we learnt how to appreciate other cultures, respecting their traditions and customs. Overall, the trip allowed people to bond and persevere with each other through an experience which forced us out of our comfort zones in an unfamiliar but beautiful country.

        "The GEP excursion to Sapa, Hanoi, was definitely the highlight of my November! We trekked through the mountain trails and immersed ourselves in the vibrant atmosphere of a local primary school. It is incredible how easy it is to overlook the differences in education, yet, in the simplicity of our interactions, we discovered a universal thread binding us all. What seemed like mere muddy treks next to rice paddies for us were everyday commutes and livelihoods for the local people, making me realise the privilege we often take for granted. I am so grateful for the opportunity to embark on this GEP trip with my friends, allowing me to have a fruitful experience."

## Bangkok, Thailand
During our GEP trip, we undertook several projects at the La Salle Bamboo School. We painted murals on the walls of the canteen, assisted in constructing mushroom huts, and built bamboo walls for their assembly hall. We organised a Sports Day for the children at the Bamboo School, and had fun playing games such as football and musical chairs with them.
Additionally, we went sightseeing to attractions like the Three Pagodas Pass and the Mon Bridge. There was also one day where we hiked to a local village to distribute food and clothing to the residents. We also had nights of cultural exchange with the students from the Blue Sky school, where we had fun learning traditional Burmese and Thai dances. The trip was a blend of meaningful contributions and enjoyable interactions, creating lasting memories for all involved.

        "The Bamboo School allowed me to connnect with teenagers who cross the Myanmar daily for education. I helped in cutting, shaving and sanding bamboo down, learning first-hand how it is used as building material. I was also allowed to assist building three huts where mushrooms will grow for students. It warmed my heart to form friendships with the children at the School and allowed me to be grateful. My favourite moment of the trip was the night sky, where we could see the outline of the milky way due to the low light pollution, that made the trip an unforgettable experience."

## Chiang Mai, Thailand (Animal conservation)
The trip to Chiang Mai enabled us Josephians to have a better understanding of conservation efforts for the elephants. Collaboration with the ChiangChill elephant sanctuary gave us the opportunity to view the elephants up close and understand the broader ecosystem in Thailand. We were also given the opportunity to interact with the local Karen people and learn about their culture, along with how they help to take care of the elephants through service work such as farming. All in all, the trip was an enriching experience for us and it deepened our knowledge of a foreign culture and helped us understand the importance of animal conservation.

        "My trip to the elephant sanctuary in Chiang Mai was definitely one of the most memorable experiences of my life. From hiking through the forests of Thailand to laughing with friends at campfires, there were many takeaways from the trip. I am grateful to have been able to understand more about elephants and what we can do to play our part to help these animals, especially since so much of the abuse that they go through is not known to the general public. Overall, the trip helped me understand more about the important role that elephants play in Thai culture, while having the opportunity to create new memories and experience new things."

        "My GEP experience in Chiangmai definitely broadened my horizons and allowed me to better understand the importance of sustainability in our environmental ecosystem. We ate food that was grown and farmed within the eco-village by the villagers themselves. This made me realise how important the environment is and how much we rely on it for sustenance. One of my key memories during this trip would be working with my group members to mix mud with our bare feet to create mud bricks, which were then used to create the walls of a mud house that people would eventually live in. Not only was I able to bond with my fellow group mates during this activity, but I was also able to learn an age-old brick making technique that many communities around the world use to create housing even to this day. Overall, this experience was eye-opening, educational and extremely fun. I was able to make long-lasting memories with my peers that we will definitely share for years to come."

## Pnom Phenh, Cambodia
SJI's Global Education Programme brought our students to the La Salle Pouthum School in Cambodia. Our students planned and organised various lessons and games for the students of the school, living amongst the fellow brothers who run the school there free of charge. Our students had the opportunity to see the students there who come from less fortunate backgrounds, which was truly an eye-opener. Students were also able to experience some of Cambodia's culture and history through learning some of their traditional dances as well as the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, where they got a glimpse into life under the Khmer Rouge regime. Overall, it was a fulfilling and eye-opening 7 days for our students as they had the opportunity to experience this once in a life time opportunity

        "To sum up the Cambodia experience in a phrase would be eye opening. Despite the language barrier, my favourite part of the trip was  interacting with the children, learning Khmer from them as well as playing football! They really felt like younger brothers and sisters in our Lasallian family. Another key moment in this trip was walking down the river at night and seeing the livelihood of the Cambodians- street foods, street games and upbeat atmosphere. These experiences really got me to empathise with how a vast majority of the world’s population lives. Overall there was a really good balance of culture, contentment and calm, a 10/10 GEP trip!"

## Taipei, Taiwan
‘Sabau!’ meaning ‘hello’, is a familiar Taiwanese Rukai tribe greeting to the Josephians who went for this Global Experience Programme (GEP).  In this GEP trip to Tainan, Taiwan, Josephains were provided with a multifaceted exploration of Taiwan's cultural and educational landscape through visiting different schools of different education levels. At Evergreen Lily Elementary School, tasked with planning activities for the students and elderly from the Rukai and Paiwan tribes, Josephians had the opportunity to understand how these villages integrate education and cultural heritage protection into their curriculum. During the visit to National Tainan Second Senior High School, Josephians followed similar-aged Taiwanese students around to experience a day in the life of a high school student in Taiwan. As classes were conducted in Chinese, our students’ comprehension abilities were put to the test, providing a unique experience unlike in Singapore.  All in all, this was an invaluable and unforgettable eye-opening experience which allowed Josephians to step out of their comfort zone to learn and grow from the rich Taiwanese culture.

        "My GEP experience in SJI was remarkable as each day in Taiwan brought forth new adventures! We visited Pingtung, where we delved into activities such as yam planting, invigorating hikes and a heartwarming homestay with the locals. Upon reaching Tainan, we explored the Pingtung University campus and engaged in a captivating coffee-making course, where we experimented with latte art. The following day at Tainan Second Senior High School, we attended classes and participated in extracurricular activities with our new Taiwanese classmates and shared our educational and cultural differences with each other. Overall, I am immensely grateful to SJI for the GEP experience as this is something I will forever hold close to my heart!"
