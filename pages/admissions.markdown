Admission to the SJI International Baccalaureate is conducted through the Ministry of Education (MOE) via the Joint 
Admissions Exercise (JAE) and is solely based on students’ performance in the Singapore-Cambridge GCE ‘O’ Level Examinations. 
Students who are currently in the Integrated Programme (IP) are expected to complete and benefit from the customised 6-year 
IP programme of your current school. Should you require advice and guidance on this matter, please refer to the school 
authorities in your current school.
