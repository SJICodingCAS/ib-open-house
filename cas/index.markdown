# Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS)

Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS) enables students to enhance their personal and 
interpersonal development as well as their social and civic development, through experiential 
learning. CAS activities should be both challenging and enjoyable, a personal journey of 
self-discovery that recognizes each student’s individual starting point.

CAS experiences should be:
* Real, purposeful activities, with significant outcomes
* Personally challenging - tasks must extend the student and be achievable in scope
* Thoughtfully considered, such as planning, reviewing progress and reporting
* reflection on outcomes and personal learning

Students must demonstrate satisfactory participation in CAS for the award of the IB Diploma. 
This is achieved through the student’s active and balanced engagement in all three strands: 
creativity, activity and service and through having demonstrated the seven learning outcomes 
observed in the student’s personal reflections.
